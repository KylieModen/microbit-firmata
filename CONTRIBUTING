Thanks for looking here! We'd love your help. The micro:bit project is only possible through contributions of companies and individuals around the world.

This project is managed on GitHub, and the best way to contribute is to jump in and fix/file issues

https://github.com/microbit-foundation/microbit-firmata

The original author of the project wrote considerable notes on the possible ways to implement micro:bit radio functionality in this project, and the possibility of running the same interface over BLE UARTs. 

If you're interested in working on any of these items, please file an issue and mention @jaustin
